// --------------- basic coroutine builders ---------------

/**
 * Launches new coroutine without blocking current thread and returns a reference to the coroutine as a [Job].
 * The coroutine is cancelled when the resulting job is [cancelled][Job.cancel].
 *
 * The [context] for the new coroutine must be explicitly specified.
 * See [CoroutineDispatcher] for the standard [context] implementations that are provided by `kotlinx.coroutines`.
 * The [context][CoroutineScope.context] of the parent coroutine from its [scope][CoroutineScope] may be used,
 * in which case the [Job] of the resulting coroutine is a child of the job of the parent coroutine.
 *
 * By default, the coroutine is immediately scheduled for execution.
 * Other options can be specified via `start` parameter. See [CoroutineStart] for details.
 * An optional [start] parameter can be set to [CoroutineStart.LAZY] to start coroutine _lazily_. In this case,
 * the coroutine [Job] is created in _new_ state. It can be explicitly started with [start][Job.start] function
 * and will be started implicitly on the first invocation of [join][Job.join].
 *
 * Uncaught exceptions in this coroutine cancel parent job in the context by default
 * (unless [CoroutineExceptionHandler] is explicitly specified), which means that when `launch` is used with
 * the context of another coroutine, then any uncaught exception leads to the cancellation of parent coroutine.
 *
 * See [newCoroutineContext] for a description of debugging facilities that are available for newly created coroutine.

 * @param context context of the coroutine
 * @param start coroutine start option
 * @param block the coroutine code

 * An optional `start` parameter is used only if the specified `context` uses a different [CoroutineDispatcher] than
 * a current one, otherwise it is ignored.
 * By default, the coroutine is immediately scheduled for execution and can be cancelled
 * while it is waiting to be executed and it can be cancelled while the result is scheduled
 * to be be processed by the invoker context.
 * Other options can be specified via `start` parameter. See [CoroutineStart] for details.
 * A value of [CoroutineStart.LAZY] is not supported and produces [IllegalArgumentException].
